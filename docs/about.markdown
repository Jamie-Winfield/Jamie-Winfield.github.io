Hi, I'm Jamie.

I've always had a passion for video games and decided I wanted to learn how to make them myself. I studied Games technology whilst at the University of the West of England Bristol where I learned C++ and C# while making games using engines such as Unity, Unreal Engine 4 and ASGE.

For my final year project I decided I wanted to take a deeper look at how game engines work under the hood by creating my own 2D game engine using the Vulkan API. This made me more interested into how game engines work and hope that in the future I can work within a team where I can work on more advanced game engines.

Alongside my passion for games I also gained a passion for the financial markets and how they both affect and are effected by the world economy, as I was learning C++ I found that while being used for game development it was also being used for high speed, low latency trading systems and began to learn algorithmic trading languages MQL4 and MQL5 which were based on C++ in my free time to explore how automated trading systems can be built.
